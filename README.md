# Haskaml

An OCaml interpreter\* written in Haskell

\* Absolutely not the main focus

## Background

As I'm taking CS 4 (Functional Programming) at Caltech, I was told that I had to manually write out how S-expressions will be evaluated. Early on in the course, we were even instructed to use a model of substituting in variables that did not reflect how S-expressions are evaluated in reality. Instead of taking 5 minutes to write this down, I instead spent too much time writing this.

The long term goal is that our program will evaluate an Ocaml script and display how it evaluates according to Professor Mike Vanier's guidelines. This means that this interpreter is more of a visualizer of how S-expressions are (incorrectly) evaluated.

The correct evaluation methods using environments will be implemented when that point in class has been reached, or when I give up.

If you are Professor Vanier, please consider this my SURF application.
